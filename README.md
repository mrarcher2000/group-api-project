# Marvel Superhero Search

## Description

The Marvel Superhero Search is a simple, but helpful tool for every comic book nerd and teaches you everything you need to know about the Marvel Universe and its characters. This project is a web-based application that utilizes the Marvel API and Google Books API to search for characters in the Marvel Universe. The drop down next to the search button toggles between the 2 API's and allows the user to search for either comic books or general information about a character. The API's then send a request to either Marvel's or Google's servers to pull information for the character searched. 

This project was made in partner with the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. All contributors can be found below.

This project is available online [here](https://mrarcher2000.github.io/group-api-project) or at https://mrarcher2000.github.io/group-api-project.

## Usage

The Marvel Superhero Search is available for common user access online at the above link. To search for a character, type in the name or first few letters of the charcter's name in the text box labeled 'SuperHero Name'. The dropdown next to the text box chooses the number of results that the user wants to display on the screen. Finally, the last dropdown box next to the 'Search' button allows the user to toggle between the Marvel API and the Google Books API. Choosing the Marvel API returns characters that are similar or the same as who you requested. Choosing the Google Books API will search through Google's database for comic books related to the character you searched for.
